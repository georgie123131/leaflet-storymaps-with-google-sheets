The Start,media/IMG_0798.jpg,,,"While I remember you saying that we aren't supposed to do ""vacation places"", one of the most interesting routes I've ever had walking was in a place far, far away from here. An Ex of mine from Australia brought me to her small town of Singleton, where we used to walk every day for about 20,000 steps. While it's been a while since I've been to each of these places, I still remember them distinctly. After all, my favorite exercise is just walking with people, and we used to walk for hours a day during the winter, exploring many random places in the countryside. I hope this will prove as enjoyable to you as it did to me when I was there. We usually started at Allan Bull Reserve, and the path goes further from here. <br><br> ",16,1,blue,"Allan Bull Reserve, Singleton Heights",-32.54691891,151.169485,,,,
Abandoned Trucks and Farm Land,media/IMG_1001.jpg,,,"When we would explore, we'd look into everything that even remotely seemed like a path for us to behold. This included, quite early in our walks, a sand lot filled with burned cars. It was hard to make out the makes of each one, but from what I remember, there were a few Ford and Toyota trucks, and some sedans. You can even see them on Google Maps if you type in the coordinates and look a bit closeby! The picture in question that I took was a bit further out, where it became muddy. Specifically, we are looking at farmland where cows would graze and windmills were in the distance. We didn't go much further shown here due to our distance from the main road as it were. <br><br>",17,2,blue,"Off-beaten bike path, Singleton",-32.52950832,151.1611212,,,,
Hidden Wallaby,media/IMG_1004.jpg,,,"Wallabies are a tiny denomination of kangaroo. Both are marsupials who carry joeys in pouches. Ironically, for being so close to ""The Bush"", this was one of the only few examples of real Australian wildlife I got to see. The only other animals I did not see in zoos only included some small spiders, magpies, and bats. No, the magpies did not attack us. Yes, there were warning signs. No, the spiders aren't as bad as they seem. Australia, ecologically speaking, is a lot tamer than people would normally expect. It feels exaggerated on social media, and I have the months of experience to say so. If anything, being a Floridian probably made me tamer to seeing natural widlife than most people. After all, it's not uncommon to see alligators and peacocks around Miami, and panthers live close by. Regardless, it is rare to spot any meaningful wildlife so close to suburbs regardless, so I guess I got kind of lucky with that shot. I didn't see any wild koalas though... those are even rarer. <br> <br>",16,3,blue,Singleton Heights,-32.53681642,151.1665417,,,,
Train Tracks at Sundown,media/IMG_1205.jpg,,,"Singleton originally started as a coal mining town, and in a sense it still is. Some of the world's largest quarries are within Australia, and the ones nearby Singleton are no exception. The trains usually go through this route to pickup and drop off coal and metals that have been mined farther out into the countryside, including here. Only a couple passenger trains come by a day, but we took this photo after 6 P.M. when no trains are running. Still, it was a beautiful sunset that we wished to see to end off the daily 20,000 that we would do. <br> <br>",16,4,blue,"Rose Point Park All Abilities Playground, Singleton",-32.56465802,151.1586548,,,,
Hillside,media/IMG_1521.jpg,,,"While we were having issues over in Australia, I decided to venture out on my own sometimes to continue the 20,000 without her. I went back around to the destroyed cars from earlier, and dared to venture further into the mud. I kept progressing, remembering just what led me so far away from home in the first place. Then I understood that my time in Australia, while filled with personal problems, wasn't bad to me locally in the slightest. I enjoyed where I was because it was incredibly memorable. Writing this, I'm sad that I didn't take further pictures, but what I can do now is tell you that Australia was a wonderful place to go to. I was never really interested in Australia until that point, and now that I was there, it felt honorable to be at a place so far away from where I normally go. Singleton, specifically, is in a sort-of ""crater"", surrounded by mountains, paths, and hills. This arguably leads to one of the highest points you can get in Singleton Valley, and I'm most proud of this photo in particular. <br> <br>",17,5,blue,NSW,-32.52691459,151.1567072,,,,
Leaving Australia,media/IMG_1522.jpg,,,"This photo was taken the same day as photo 5, but while I was at the summit. As the sun was going down, I wanted one last picture of the trek that I climbed to get there. It was so that I can remember that I can do anything, regardless of who was with me. It was muddy, my shoes were ruined, and I was very cold, but I did make it. As the sun went through the valley, I took that photo to remember that it'll be alright, and that I've made it this far. Thank you for letting me show you just a sliver of my many walks in this random town in Australia. If I ever so happen to go again, I will take more pictures of where I was as well as where I plan to go. <br> <br>",15,6,blue,"Rixs Creek, NSW ",-32.52592727,151.1547362,,,,
